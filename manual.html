<p> This is the manual for ProBIND, release 2.2. ProBIND is an
application for managing DNS servers. The present release is probably
not suitable for users who are not knowledgeable about DNS in general.
If you want to learn about DNS in general, or BIND in particular, then I
highly recommend <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/dns3">DNS and
BIND</a>. </p>

<h2><a name="new2.2">What is new in version 2.1</h2>
<ul>
<li>New zone types added - forward, stub, static-stab</li>
<li>Servers has now bind version option which allows to define, if server support new types or not. For now, only one check is implemented - if
bind version is lower then 9.10, then static-stub became forward.
<li>Zone editor has now record filter and limit maximum number of records on the screen. It allows to edit really big zones.
<li>Search has now search by comment (absent in previous version).
<li>Database now has version number, so system can detect if database is not from the current version of the code.
<li>Zone View/Edit modes are now controlled by the separate buttons on the top of zone content.
<li>Slave, Forward, Stub and Static Stub zones can now have up to 4 master or forwarders IP (and more can be added directly
by zone update menu).
</ul>
<h2><a name="new2.2">What is new in version 2.1</h2><ul>
<li>Comment added into the records.
<li>Full zone can be edited at once now.
<li>Push scripts improved.
<li>As an option, change control script added which can reportd DNS changes to the email and/or jira.
</ul>
<h2><a name="about">About ProBIND</a></h2>
<p> ProBIND is a web application for administrating one or more BIND
servers. It is intended for small to medium sized ISPs, but there is no
reason why it couldn't be used wherever many zones must be managed
across a set of master and slave servers. Version 2.0 was adapted for
the middle size corporative network. </p>
<p> ProBIND is written in PHP4, and uses a MySQL database for storing
all information about the DNS servers managed. The database contents are
pushed onto the DNS servers only when a ProBIND user explicitly
requests it (it is also possible to execute the update from a cron job).
The update is done by generating configuration- and zone files based on
the information in the database. The files are then uploaded to the DNS
servers. </p>
<p> The strengths of ProBIND are: </p>
<ul>
  <li>You can easily search zones, either by domain name or a free-text
search on zone annotations. </li>
  <li> You can search for records across all zones, e.g. to find all WWW
records that are CNAMES, and which point to a host with the string "foo"
in its name. </li>
  <li> For those who often create zones which have a lot of standard
fluff, e.g. standard TXT and MX records, the TEMPLATE pseudo-zone will
help. When creating a new zone, the contents of the TEMPLATE pseudo-zone
are copied into the new zone. </li>
  <li> You can add comments to the records, zones and servers. </li>
  <li> NS records are automatically generated for all your zones. You
may never have to add a single NS record to your database. </li>
  <li> If you let ProBIND handle your reverse zones (the in-addr.arpa
zones), it will automatically generate PTR records for all A records in
the database. You may never have to add a single PTR record to your
database. </li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="add">Adding a zone</a></h2>
<p> This page has two sections, separated by a horizontal bar. You
create either a new master zone or a slave zone, by filling out the
fields and clicking the "Add" button in the appropriate section. The
domain name you enter is checked for basic syntax, i.e. it must contain
at least one dot, and it may not already exist in the database. </p>
<p> A master domain is one that has been delegated to the DNS servers
you manage with ProBIND, by an outside domain registry, e.g. NSI. When
you create a master zone, the zone is initialized with a copy of the
records in the TEMPLATE pseudo-zone. </p>
<p> A slave zone is one that is managed elsewhere, but which your server
is a backup for. The zone data will be fetched from the master server
you specify. You can specify either an IP number or a hostname as the
master server, but if you specify a hostname, that hostname must be
resolvable. </p>
<p>Each zone can contain options, which will be added into the zone
description in the named.conf file on master servers (options are not
applied to the zones on slave servers). By default, options are
inherited from the TEMPLATE zone and can be edited in 'details' section. </p>
<h2><a name="del">Deleting a zone</a></h2>
<p> Enter the full name of the zone you wish to delete, and click on the
"Delete" button. You will be prompted for a confirmation before the
deletion takes place. </p>
<p> If you would rather point and click to identify the zone to be
deleted, then locate the zone on the <a href="#zones">Browse zones</a>
page, and click on the "Delete" button on the zone page. </p>
<p> NB: There is no "undelete" feature in ProBIND. So watch your clicks.
When you delete a zone, you will be requested to confirm operation one
more time, but after it, zone can not be 'undeleted'. </p>
<h2><a name="zones">Browsing zones</a></h2>
<p> This is the main page in ProBIND. The area below the main menu bar
is split into two frames. The left frame is used to search and list
zones from the database. The right frame is used to display the contents
of individual zones selected in the left frame. </p>
<p> In the left frame, you select what to search in: All zones, all
master zones, all slave zones, or the annotations on the zones. This is
combined with the text in the "For" field, to extract a list of matching
zones from the database. The search is of the case-insensitive substring
variety. Some examples: </p>
<ul>
  <li>To list all zones in the database, select "All zones", clear the
text field and click on "Search". </li>
  <li>To list all .com zones you have authoritative information for,
select "Master zones", enter ".com" (without the quotes) in the text
field and click on Search. </li>
  <li>To find all zones where the annotations have been modified in
October, select "Annotations" and enter "oct" in the text field. Then
click "Search". This assumes that the people who maintain the
annotations date their entries. </li>
  <li>To find all slave zones in the database, select "Slave zones" and
clear the text field. Then click on "Search". </li>
</ul>
<p> The display in the right frame consists of three distinct types of
information: Zone parameters, explicit resource records and
automatically generated (implicit) resource records. </p>
<p>The zone parameter block on top begins with the name of the zone
being displayed, and contain two buttons: "Details", and  "Update". In
between there are 6 fields, 5 of which can be modified: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The Zonefile is the filename of the zonefile on the DNS servers.
This name is automatically generated when you create a zone, or it is
inherited from the original zone file that was <a href="#import">imported</a>
into the database. Normally, you would have no need to change this. </li>
  <li>The Serial no. field contains the last serial number used to
update the zonefile on the DNS servers. This field is automatically
updated each time you perform the <a href="#push">Push updates</a>
operation. Normally, you would have no need to change this. </li>
  <li>Refresh interval. This is how often a secondary (slave) DNS
server shall check with the master for updates. When the zone is
created, this value is inherited from the TEMPLATE zone. NB: Refresh and
retry values are less important with modern (BIND8) DNS serves, as they
implement the NOTIFY scheme described in RFC1996. </li>
  <li>Retry period. If a secondary DNS server cannot reach a master
server, this is the period it will wait before retrying. </li>
  <li>Expire period. This is how long a secondary DNS server will
remember zone data from a master server it cannot reach. At the end of
this interval, all data for a zone are discarded. </li>
  <li>Updated. This flag displays the status of the zone in the
database. "No" means that the zone data have not been updated since the
last time the database was synchronized with the DNS servers. "Yes"
means that is has. </li>
</ul>
For a discussion of these parameters, and recommendations for their
values, see the <a href="http://www.ripe.net/ripe/docs/ripe-203.html">
RIPE recommendations</a>.
<p> The buttons have the following uses: </p>
<ul>
  <li>"Details" takes you to a sub-page that contains zone
configuration options (which should be changed by experts only) and
information about when the zone was created in the database, when it was
last changed and a text annotation. The annotation is useful both as a
place to document e.g. contact information about a zone, and as a log
book where the DNS maintainers can describe what they did, and when. </li>
  <li>"Update". Click on this button after updating any of the text
fields above, or if you just want this zone to be in the next upload of
the database to the DNS servers. </li>
</ul>
<p>Next section begins with "Add RR" button, and can be in one of two
forms - "view" form when it shows the whole zone and allow to edit
single RR only, and "edit" form when all records can be edited on this
page. The reason is simple - "edit" mode does not allow to use "find on
the page" feature of the browthers, and is slow in case of a very long
(thousand records) zone. This section will contain a set of buttons: </p>
<ul>
  <li>"Add RR" takes you to a sub-page where you can add Resource
Records to the zone. </li>
  <li>"Edit zone (total)" (view mode only) - switch to edit mode; </li>
  <li>"edit" - allow to edit a single RR record; </li>
  <li>"Delete Zone?" does just that - it takes you to a form where you
must confirm your intention to delete the displayed zone. </li>
</ul>
<p> After the button row follows the explicit resource records. These
are just the records which have been entered in the database, either
manually, or <a href="#import">imported</a>. There will always be an
SOA record, which cannot be deleted, and where you can only change the
TTL (Time To Live) value. NB: If you change the TTL for the SOA record,
you will also change the TTL for all implicit resource records, and for
all those explicit resource records that had the same TTL as the SOA
record. The TTL in the SOA record also becomes the default TTL for new
resource records. </p>
<p> There is an "Upd" (for update) and "Del" (for delete) button for
each resource record. These buttons updates the RR in the database, or
deletes it, respectively. NB: The "Upd" button affects all resource
record changed on the screen. When you change a record, the button for
it changes it's color, but you can continue with other records and press
any of this butons in the very end. So if you want to update a lot of
records, you have to change this records, and then press any "Upd"
button. In "view" mode, you have to press "edit" button next to the
record to edit this record, or you can press "Edit zone (total)" button
and edit as much records as you need. </p>
<p>Button "Delete zone" in the end of edit zone send you to the "Delete
zone" page where you will be requested to confirm deletion once more
time. </p>
<p> The last part of the zone display is the implicit resource records.
These records do not exist in the database, and you cannot manipulate
them directly. They will exist in the zone files uploaded to the DNS
servers. For most zones, this will just be the NS records implied by the
DNS server descriptions you enter on the <a href="#servers">DNS servers</a>
page. For in-addr.arpa zones, PTR records implied by A records in the
database will also appear. </p>
<h2><a name="records">Browsing records</a></h2>
<p> On this page you can browse the resource records in the database.
NB: you can only browse explicit records, not the implicit ones you can
see in the bottom of the zone display when you <a href="#zones">browse
zones</a>. </p>
<p> This page consists of 5 entry fields and a "Search" button. You can
leave any field blank, in which case it wont influence the search. If
you fill out more than one field, only resource records which match all
your criteria will be returned.  The fields are: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Zone. This is the domain name of the zone containing records,
e.g. example.com </li>
  <li>Domain. This is the domain name of the record you are looking
for, e.g. www. </li>
  <li>Type. This is the resource record type, e.g. A. </li>
  <li>Pref. This is the preference value for MX records. </li>
  <li>Data. This is the RDATA field of the resource record, e.g. an IP
number. </li>
</ul>
In all fields, except the type field, you can specify a substring match
by applying the '%' as a wildcard. E.g., if you want to find all 'www'
records in .net domains, you would enter '%.net' in the Zone field, and
'www' in the Domain field.
<p> When you click on the "Search" button, you get a page back with the
search form at the top, in case you want to refine your search criteria.
Below this, you get a list of the records which match your search
criteria. If more than 50 records were found, use the Next and Previous
buttons to navigate through the list. </p>
<h2><a name="misc">Miscellaneous tools</a></h2>
<p> When you click on "Misc. tools" in the main menu bar, you get a
second menu bar with 7 choices: </p>
<h3><a name="stats">Statistics</a></h3>
<p> The statistics display is the default display of the "tools" pages.
It contains a count of all zones and (explicit) resource records in the
database, and a summary of the DNS server descriptions. </p>
<p> If the database contains updates which have not yet been uploaded to
the DNS servers, this page will also have a list of zones which have
been added, updated or deleted since the last time the DNS servers were
brought up to date. </p>
<p> NB: Sometimes you may see that one or more in-addr.arpa zones in the
list of changed zones, even if no one have touched them. The explanation
is that changes to other zones have touched one or more A records, with
IP numbers which correspond to those in-addr.arpa zones. This insures
that changes to A records will also result in changes to the
automatically generated PTR records on the DNS servers. </p>
<h3><a name="ext">External consistency checks</a></h3>
<p> There are two different kinds of external consistency checks: One
that finds all lame delegations, and one that finds all delegations
which are not quite lame, but which do not quite match the NS servers
known to the database either. </p>
<p> Both types of consistency checks require the hostname or IP number
of a DNS server <b>NOT</b> managed by this ProBIND installation. The
whole idea of having an external consistency check is to check that you
are in agreement with the outside world, and you can only do that by
asking a name server controlled by someone else. </p>
<p> The name server field will contain a default external DNS server.
This default value is controlled by the DEFAULT EXTERNAL DNS value in
the <a href="#settings">settings</a>. </p>
<h3><a name="int">Internal consistency checks</a></h3>
<p> Currently, there are four kinds of internal consistency checks.
Actually, it would be more accurate to call them checks for
well-formedness of the database. Except for the "Find resource records
with invalid data" check, none of the records found by these checks are
necessarily errors. </p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
  <li>Find PTR records with no matching A records. This can be useful
if you have <a href="#import">imported&gt;</a> a lot of data, and now
have doubts about whether they are all current. </li>
  <li>Find multiple A records for the same IP address. Having many A
records which point to the same IP number is common practice today. But
sometimes it is nice to get a list of all the places it is done. </li>
  <li>Find zones with too few MX records. There is nothing wrong with
not having any MX records for a zone, it can be a deliberate decision.
But if you have <a href="#import">imported</a> a lot of zones, it can be
nice to verify that they all have the expected minimum of two MX'es. </li>
  <li>Find resource records with invalid data. Any records returned by
this check <b>are</b> errors. All MX records are checked for a
preference value. All A records are checked to make sure that they point
to an IP number. </li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="list">Annotated domain list</a></h3>
<p> This page can be very long. It is a list of all domains contained in
the database, as well as any existing annotations for those domains. </p>
<h3><a name="ip">IP range display</a></h3>
<p> This page is utterly useless if you have no reverse (in-addr.arpa)
zones in your database. It gives you a condensed view of which IP
numbers have been allocated. </p>
<h3><a name="bulk">Bulk update</a></h3>
<p> Sometimes, the mechanism for deciding which zones needs to be
updated on the DNS servers is just not good enough. E.g. if you have
added a new DNS server, if one of your DNS servers appears to have
missed some updates, or if you change the RNAME setting. In those
situations, you want to make sure that all your DNS servers get a
complete upload of everything in the ProBIND database. </p>
<p> This is what the bulk update feature is for. When you perform a bulk
update, all data in the database are marked updated. This makes sure
that the next <a href="#push">push updates</a> operation will upload the
entire database to the DNS servers. </p>
<p> NB: You must confirm this operation by clicking on an appropriately
scary-looking button, since this can make the next DNS server update a
very slow operation. </p>
<h3><a name="settings">Settings</a></h3>
<p> On this page you control 4 ProBIND parameters which don't really fit
anywhere else. This is also where you break hanging database locks. The
parameters are: </p>
<ul>
  <li>DEFAULT EXTERNAL DNS. This is the default DNS server suggested
for the external consistency checks. This would normally be a DNS server
operated by your upstream provider. </li>
  <li>DEFAULT PTR DOMAIN. When generating the zone file for an
in-addr.arpa zone, ProBIND automatically generates PTR records implied
by A records elsewhere in the database. And, since some DNS
administrators don't like to run with their arpa zones empty, it also
generates PTR records for all IP numbers not explicitly allocated in the
database. Those PTR records point to a host named
"host-aaa-bbb-ccc-ddd" in the default PTR domain. E.g: if you enter
"unassigned.mydomain.net" here, PTR records for your unassigned IP
numbers will point to "host-aaa-bbb-ccc-ddd.unassigned.mydomain.net".
Special name, <span style="font-weight: bold;">NONE</span>, is used to
turn off this feature.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Default MNAME. This is the MNAME parameter in the SOA records
generated for your zones. The MNAME is the origin of your zones. This
field should contain the name of your master DNS server. </li>
  <li>Default RNAME. This is the RNAME parameter in the SOA records
generated for your zones. The RNAME is the email address for your DNS
administrator. Traditionally, this would be root@yourdomain.net or
hostmaster.mydomain.net. NB: It doesn't matter if you enter a '@' or a
'.' here - ProBIND automatically converts it to the proper all-dots
form. </li>
  <li>Two Step Update - if checked, turn on 2 step update mode, which
allows to verify update logs before applying update to the remote name
server (so increasing reliability).</li>
  <li>Slave On Slaves -- in this mode, ProBIND allocate slave ones on
all name servers. By default, slave zones are allocated on the master
servers only.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p> Sometimes you will see an additional field, below the "Update
settings" button. This will only happen when someone has started an
operation that locks parts of the database, usually to make sure that
the uploads to the DNS servers get a proper snapshot of the database. If
this operation hangs, or does not complete for one reason or another,
the database lock is not released. Before you use the provided button
to break the lock, please wait a few minutes and reload this page. </p>
<h3><a name="servers">DNS servers</a></h3>
<p> In order to function properly, ProBIND must have some information
about the DNS servers it is supposed to manage. This is where you supply
that information. The page consists of a list of DNS servers already
defined, and an "Add another server" button. Clicking on the button (or
on one of the existing servers) takes you to a detailed DNS server
description, which must be correctly filled out: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The name of the DNS server. This must be the fully qualified
hostname. If your DNS server has multiple hostnames, take some care in
selecting the proper one here. </li>
  <li>The IP number corresponding to the hostname must also be
supplied. </li>
  <li>You must specify whether the server is a master or a slave. Only
master servers receive full named.conf and zone files. Slave servers
receive just enough information to request data from the masters. There
are no restrictions on the number of masters and slaves you define, but
it would be usual to define at least one master. </li>
  <li>You must specify whether ProBIND should push updates to the DNS
server or not. Why on earth would anyone define a DNS server here, but
not want to update it? One reason could be a multi-homed DNS server that
receives updates through one network interface (lets call it "inside"),
but is reachable by the general public only on another network
interface (lets call it "outside"). In that situation you would define
two DNS servers here, one for each interface. The outside interface
would be published in an NS record, but not updated, and the inside
interface would be updated, but not published. </li>
  <li>You must also specify whether ProBIND should publish the
existence of the DNS server in the NS records it generates. See the note
above. </li>
  <li>ProBIND also needs to know which directory on the DNS server
contains the named.conf and zone files. </li>
  <li>A great many DNS administrators wants or needs to add some global
options to the named.conf file. This is indirectly supported in ProBIND
through the use of templates, and directly by the server options. Every
server is configured using a template directory, which is located in the
'templates' directory. Each template directory must contain  (at least)
named.tmpl file, and contains (usially) reconfig.sh script (which is
called when configuration changed) and such files and root.hint,
localhost.rev zone and so on. Files from template directory are just
copied to the server, except named.tmpl file which is used to generate
real named.conf file. The template named.tmpl is essentially the entire
named.conf file, except for the actual zone definitions. When the
named.conf file is prepared for upload to the DNS server, the template
is read, and 4 macros are expanded: $ZONE_DIR, $OPTIONS, $ACL and
$ZONE_DEFINITIONS. They expand to the directory containing zone files,
server options, list of secondary servers (for the access lists) and
the actual zone definitions (whith zone options from the zone
definitions), respectively. A minimal named.tmpl template would look
like this (this template mean that you need to create / import
0.0.127.in-addr.arpa zone)::
    <pre>options {<br>	directory "$ZONE_DIR";<br>	$OPTIONS<br>};<br><br>$ZONE_DEFINITIONS<br><br>zone "." {<br>	type hint;<br>	file "db.cache";<br>};<br></pre>
  </li>
  <li>ProBIND also needs to know how to upload the file to the DNS
server. The script must exist in the sbin directory of the ProBIND
installation. The script is called from a working directory containing
the generated named.conf and all the zone files that must be uploaded.
The script gets a list of operations - '-PUSH' to push a files, and
'-CONF' to run reconfiguration (it is ./reconmfig.sh file from the
template directory), and two parameters: the hostname of the DNS server
to update, and the directory on the server to upload to. Additionally,
the working directory may contain a file named "deadlist". It will
contain a list of zones which have been deleted from the database, and
which should also be deleted from the DNS server. It is the
responsibility of this script to restart the DNS server process after a
successful upload. See the "push.local", "push.remote" and "nop" scripts
for examples. </li>
  <li>Finally, you can add a bit of text to describe the server. </li>
</ul>

<p> The final operation in ProBIND is the step where the contents of the
database is used top generate (update) configuration files for the name
servers (this are named.conf, zone files and other files found in the
template directory), push this files to the server, and reconfig the
server. </p>
<p> "push" window contain checkboxes for all 3 operations: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Generate files - system will generate files from data base if
necessary; </li>
  <li>Push files - system will push files to the server if necessary; </li>
  <li>Reconfig server - system will ask a server to reconfigure if
necessary; </li>
</ul>
<p>Next raw contain main button, which name is  "START UPDATE" or
"COMPLETE UPDATE" (if files was generated and pushed already), and table
of the servers with the columns: </p>
<ul>
  <li>state - can be green "OK" (no any operations necessary), yellow
"need update", "need push" or "need reconfig" (update is necessary for
this server), or red "error" (error had place during last update). </li>
  <li>Do not apply - thic checkbox blocks operation for this server; it
is checked up itself if last update caused an error, to prevent more
damage to the server; </li>
  <li>Test - calls test program for this server, which allow to send
request and see results; </li>
  <li>View - allow to see named.conf file and server directory (with
all files generated for the server); </li>
</ul>
<p> If some servers has a yellow status, they need to be reconfigured.
To reconfigure servers, just click on "START UPDATE" button. Window
below will show you update process, with a reference to the log file
which contain output of all scripts which runned during this process. If
two step (default) update is configured, system will show you 'yellow'
status 'need reconfig' once again, and will check out 'Reconfig server'
checkbox; just click on the 'COMPLETE UPDATE' once again. </p>
<p> It is a good idea to verify logs on the window below (just click on
the 'LOG' message) before doing next step of reconfiguration. </p>
<p> In case of error, server will show you red 'error' message, and
future update will be blocked; you need to determine (reading 'logs' and
looking into the named.conf file) the reason of the error and correct
it, then repeat 'PUSH' operation again. By default, updates to such
server are blocked (see checkbox) and if you just repeat "PUSH" (for
example, error was caused by the network problem and you want to repeat
an attempt without any changes in the data base), you need to uncheck
this checkbox to apply update to the server. </p>
<p> You have "Misc. tools -&gt; Bulk update" button to make a full
update of all files, it takes a very long time. </p>
<p> It is possible that update was cancelled by the web server, or
freeze forever, or die by some reason. In this case, operation will be
locked until you go to the "Misc. tools" and remove this lock manually.
Be careful doing this, it is "last resort" tool. </p>
<p> The mechanics of the upload process is controlled by the DNS <a
 href="#servers">server descriptions</a>. </p>
<p> NB: This operation can take a very long time. </p>
<h2><a name="import">Import</a></h2>
<p> You probably already manage a lot of zones if you are looking at
this program. This means that you are also not interested in manually
entering all your existing zones through the web interface. This is
where the import script enters the picture. </p>
<p> To import your existing configuration, copy named.conf and all of
your zone files into a directory on your ProBIND host. </p>
<p> Then execute this command (assuming that you installed ProBIND in
/www/htdocs/probind and all named.conf stuff in /tmp/namedb): </p>
<p> cd /www/htdocs/probind; etc/import -v /tmp/namedb/named.conf | tee
import.log </p>
<p> Be sure that you enter <b>full</b> name of the named.conf file - php
script do not understand relative names. </p>
<p> Review the import log and the database carefully. You do not want to
update your BIND servers until your are confident that the database
accurately represents your DNS data. </p>
<p>If you want to import file names from the zones, add '-F' option. It
is not recommended because if you had a subdirectories, then must be
created in the HOSTS/server_name directory before you generate a files,
and pusth script must support this mode. </p>
<p> If you want to replace existing domains by the new ones, use '-d'
option - if zone already exists, it will be deleted first. </p>
<p> Import understand zone options and can create 'option' field in the
imported zones; verify this options before pushing any updates to the
server. By default, zones must have option </p>
<pre> allow-transfer { $ACL };<br></pre>
which allows all secondary servers to 'xfer' zone. In some cases, you
should prefer to change TEMPLATE options BEFORE any 'import' (for
example, if you do not want to maintain 'allow-transfer{}' options in
the zones).
<p> If you have a lot of comments in your zone files, run import with
the -a flag too (i.e. import -av named.conf). That way the unaltered
text of a zone file is put into the ProBIND database as a comment text
for the zone. </p>
<p> If you have a very complex named configuration, you need to
configure named.conf options. Generally you have a two methods to do it: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Create separate template directory for every bind you want to
manage; copy all configuration files into it; import zones. After it,
remove all zone files and directories from new template directory, and
edit convert named.conf into named.tmpl by replacing all zone
information onto the macro $ZONE_DEFINITIONS and add $OPTIONS macro into
the options section. Do not forget to copy (and edit if necessary)
script 'reconfig.sh' into the template directory. If you change template
for the existing server and want to update server directory, check a
box 'Update host from template?' in the server menu and 'update' server
description (<b>Misc Tools -&lt; Servers -&lt; <i>server</i></b>).</li>
  <li>use a standard template, and add all necessary options into the
'options' section of the server. </li>
</ul>
Always verify generated files (by clicking on them in '<b>Update</b>'
menu).
