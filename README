What is ProBIND
===============

ProBIND is a web application for administrating one or more BIND servers.
It is intended for small to medium sized ISPs, but there is no reason
why it couldn't be used wherever many domains must be managed across
a set of master and slave servers.

ProBIND is written in PHP4, and uses a MySQL database for storing all
information about the DNS servers managed. The database contents are
pushed onto the DNS servers only when a ProBIND user explicitly requests
it  (it is also possible to execute the update from a cron job). The
update is done by generating configuration- and zone files based on the
information in the database. The files are then copied to the DNS servers.

The strengths of ProBIND are:

- You can easily search domains, either by domain name or a free-text
search on domain annotations.

- You can search for records across all domains, e.g. to find all WWW
records that are CNAMES, and which point to a host with the string
"foo" in its name.

- For those who often create domains which have a lot of standard fluff, 
e.g. standard TXT and MX records, the TEMPLATE pseudo-domain will help.
Any records you add the TEMPLATE will automatically be added to newly
created domains.

- NS records are automatically generated for all your domains. You
may never have to add a single NS records to your database.

- If you let ProBIND handle your reverse domains (the in-addr.arpa zones),
it will automatically generate PTR records for all A records in the database.
You may never have to add a single PTR record to your database.

Version 0.2 is currently used for all DNS administration at Proventum.
We think it is good enough to be useful for other organizations. If
someone has ideas for making it even better, we would like very much to
hear about it. Actual patches or working code will even more welcome.

It is my ambition that ProBIND becomes a standard way of managing DNS 
servers in the Open Source community. Be forewarned: it is good enough for 
the my needs, but probably not good enough for the world at large - yet. 
Please help me make this software better! Feel free to email me at 
fjohansen@proventum.net if you have any suggestions for improvements.

Prerequisites
=============

MySQL-3.22.32 or later
php-4.0.2 or later
apache-1.3.12 or later
perl-5.005 or later
openssh (optional)

The Net::DNS perl module must also be installed in order for the
consistency checkers to work.

The apache server should have the MySQL and PHP modules available. In
addition to the PHP interpreter embedded in the apache web server, the
CGI version must also be installed, or ProBIND won't be able to update
your BIND server(s). 

Installation
============

The installation procedure is described in the INSTALL file.

At this point, the installation process for ProBIND is a bit convoluted.
It is my ambition to streamline this process in later versions. In the
meantime, feel free to send me an email at fjohansen@proventum.net if
you run into problems.

Security
========

WARNING: You probably should NOT install this on a web server with access
for users who should not be able to manipulate your BIND servers. The
current method for distributing zone files to the servers is easily
misused by anyone with access to the ProBIND directory.

Limits, bugs and misfeatures
============================

The import script is not able to deal with zone files larger than 64K
bytes if the -a option is used.

The import script is somewhat limited in capabilities.

ProBIND sees a BIND server as being in either master or slave configuration.
This version does not support mixing those roles.

In-addr.arpa zones are currently only supported for 8-bit subnets, e.g.
17.168.192.in-addr.arpa is supported, but 16.172.in-addr.arpa is not.

Only a subset of RR types is presently supported: A, CNAME, MX, NS, PTR, 
TXT and HINFO.

No feedback from the BIND log files.

contributed a lot of useful suggestions, without which this software
would almost certainly be utterly useless to anyone other than myself.
