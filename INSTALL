This is outdated manual. Use Install2.2.html instead.


===========================================================================
This is a step-by-step procedure for getting started with ProBIND.
In the examples, I will assume that your Apache document root is in
/www/htdocs, and that the stand-alone PHP interpreter is installed as
/usr/local/bin/php

0 Backup
========

Before you do anything to an actual, live DNS server, make sure
that you have a usable backup of the configuration and zone files! 

1 Prerequisites
================

Make sure that you have the following software installed (most of
which is included in recent distributions of Linux):

mysql-3.22.32 or later
php-4.0.2 or later
apache-1.3.12 or later
perl-5.005 or later
Net::DNS-0.12 or later
openssh (optional)

The Net::DNS perl module is available from CPAN, or from this URL:
http://www.perl.com/CPAN/authors/id/MFUHR/Net-DNS-0.12.tar.gz

The apache server must have the mysql and PHP modules available. 

The only unusual bit about these packages, is that PHP must be installed
_both_ as an Apache module, and as a CGI interpreter, i.e as a stand-
alone interpreter. I am not aware of any RPMs of stand-alone PHP4, so
you will have to compile and install this yourself:

1.1 Installing stand-alone PHP4
===============================

Download the PHP4 sources from http://www.php.net/mirrors.php. Unpack
the tarball somewhere, e.g. /home/your/src/php. Change to this directory.
Then execute these commands:

./configure --with-mysql
make
make install

1.2 Configure PHP
================

Configure php, for the configuration, verify /usr/local/etc/php.ini,
/usr/local/etc/php.standalone/php.ini files (names depends of your php version),
and set up variables if it is version is 4.2.3 or bigger:

   register_globals = On
   register_argc_argv = On

Modern php have differnt php.ini for the php module and standalone php
interpreter, so be sure to configure both module and interpreter.

2 Install the ProBIND software
===============================

Unpack the ProBIND tarball somewhere that is reachable by your apache 
server. Usually, this would be in a directory in the document root for
your Apache installation, e.g. /www/htdocs/probind. Change to this
directory.

2.1 MySQL configuration
=======================

Now you must create a MySQL database instance. The name of the database 
instance is not important, so pick something descriptive, e.g. 'probind'. 
You should also create a MySQL user for ProBIND.

mysql -u root -p
Enter password:
mysql>create database ProBIND;
mysql>quit

NB: There is no need to run the MySQL database and the Apache server
on the same host. 

2.2 Edit inc/config.inc
=======================

The inc/config.inc file is a mini PHP script, which enables ProBIND to
find its way around your installation. An example of config.inc is
provided in the tarball. It contains 6 settings, which you must edit
to reflect your installation:

$TOP
	The directory you unpacked ProBIND in, e.g /www/htdocs/probind
$MYSQL_HOST
	The host where MySQL is running, e.g. "localhost". 
$MYSQL_DB
	The name of the MySQL database, e.g. "probind".
$MYSQL_USER
	The MySQL username that ProBIND should use to log into MySQL.
$MYSQL_PASSWD
	The MySQL password that ProBIND should use to log into MySQL.
$UPDATE_LOG
	The path to a log file that will be appended to each time you
	run an update in ProBIND. This is very useful for debugging
	the update script. E.g. "/var/log/probind.log", or "/dev/null".
$DEFAULT_PUSH = "push.remote"
$DEFAULT_DIR  = "/var/named9";
$DEFAULT_TMPL = "v9-master";
	Defaults for the server setting;

$TEMPL_DIR
$HOST_DIR
$LOG_DIR
	Working directories - templates (do not change), place for the generated directories,
	place for the log files. It is recommended to use defaults, and link (if necessary)
	real directories to this place by symlinks.

$HOST_URL
$LOG_URL
	The same directories by for the web references (relative to the probind home).

2.3 Database initialization
===========================

Then load the etc/mktables.sql file into the MySQL database you just
created:

mysql -u probinduser -p probind < etc/mktables.sql
Enter password:

This concludes basic installation, you should now be able to open the
web interface in a browser. The database is still empty though. In the
next phase, you create the settings for further operations.

2.4 Creade work directories
===========================

Create two work directories (or symlinks to the existing directories);
they must be writable by the 'http' server which run PROBIND:
   - HOSTS - place for the host directories
   - LOGS - log directory
http server must  support Indexing in this directories. If you are not sure how to
do it, create .htaccess file in HOME directiry:
 
 echo > HOSTS/.htaccess
 Options Indexes
 FancyIndexing on
 ^D
 

2.5 Check and edit if necessary program names in scripts
========================================================

Run
  grep perl */*
  grep bash */*

and verify if your system has perl and bash on the proper place; edit scripts
or set up symlink if necessary.

2.6 Configure .htaccess amd tools/.htaccess files.
=================================================

By default, access require group 'dns' and ProBIND configuration (including
cleaning locks) require dnsadm group; change .htaccess and toosl/.htaccess if
you need other access rules.

3 Configure the ProBIND software
=================================

Open the ProBIND web interface. If you installed ProBIND directly
in the Apache document root, open your browser on this URL: 
http://yourserver/probind

3.1 Settings
============

Click the 'Misc. tools' link in the top frame. Then select 'Settings'
in the sub-menu that appears.  Fill out the four fields according to
your needs and click the 'Update settings' button.

3.2 Describing your BIND servers
================================

Now you must tell the database about your BIND servers. Click 'Servers'
on the submenu. Add a description for each server you wish to manage
through the ProBIND interface. For each server, you must specify its
hostname, an IP number and some supplemental information that ProBIND
needs: If the server is used as a master or slave server, whether it
should receive updates from ProBIND, and whether the server should 
appear in NS records for the domains managed by ProBIND. The latter
two settings makes it possible to use ProBIND e.g. while you are
migrating a BIND server from one host to another, or deals with
a dual-interface server that must receive updates through one interface,
but speaks with the outside world on another.

Three fields in the server description are used when delivering an
update to the server. The first field tells ProBIND where the zonefiles
exist on the server, e.g. /var/named. NB: ProBIND expects that the
named.conf file exists in the same directory as the zone files. You may
have to create a symlink in /etc to /var/named/named.conf to alleviate
this. Also NB: All files in this directory are subject to being completely
rewritten/overwritten/deleted by ProBIND. If you have some interesting
hacks in your named.conf, be sure to put them into the ProBIND template
file before you update the BIND server. You can use 'Server options' and macro $OPTIONS in the
template file, as well.

You must also specify a template directory for the name server. It is one of the
directories from $TEMPL_DIR. You can copy one of pre-defined template directories and create
your own templates. 'named.tmpl' file is a template for 'named.conf', with the macros
  $OPTIONS - server options;
  $ZONE_DIR - zone directory;
  $ZONE_DEFINITIONS - replaced by the zone definitions generated by the system;

Finally, you must specify a script that will copy zonefiles to the
BIND server, and then restart the BIND server. This script must exist
in the sbin directory of ProBIND installation. See the push script
included in the distribution, it is based on openssh for secure access
to the BIND server host. If you want to try out ProBIND without
risk to your servers, specify the included 'nop' script in this field.

3.2 'rsync' setting
====================

If (most likely) you use push.remote script, you need to configure ssh to work without
password for the proper 'rsync' work. By default, push.remote use 'ssh' (or ssh2, if exists)
to the user 'named' on the host by it's IP address. Such steps are recommended:

(1) Create user 'named' for the named control functions on the name server;

(2) Create a directory for the 'named' configuration and make a link
    ln -s $DIR/named.conf /etc/named.conf

(3) Sun solaris - check that init.d scripts run your (right) named server instead
    of (if it exists) old urgly 'in.named' server. Other system - set up proper script.

(4) Create '.ssh' (or .ssh2) directory on the name server, and configure login without the password;
    If your ProBIND system use 'openssh':
    - generate .ssh/id_dsa, id_dsa.pub and id_dsa_ssh2.pub
    - copy id_dsa.pub into .ssh directory on the host running 'named' if it use 'openssh';
    - copy id_dsa_ssh2.pub into .ssh2  directory on the host running 'named' if it use
    comercial 'ssh', and edit 'authorisation' file in .ssh2 directory. Consult manual in all other
    cases;
(5) login as probind, and try to run 'ssh -n named HOST' where HOST is ip address of all hosts
    running 'named'; confirm all prompts if necessary. In the result, this command should not ask
    any passwords or confirmations.
(6) You can configure 'host' based login method which is a little more complicated, consult manuals.

   REMEMBER - to run a script, ProBIND (which work with the user id of your http server) need
   to run 'rsync' and 'rsync' in turn need to run 'ssh' without the password. So, configure 'ssh'
   first and check everything manually.

4 Start using ProBIND
=====================

At this point you should click 'Browse domains' and flesh out the
TEMPLATE pseudo-domain. If you have some data which should apply
to all your domains, add it now. This might include TXT or MX
records which all your domains should contain. 

NB: DO NOT ADD ANY NS RECORDS TO YOUR TEMPLATE! NS records for your 
servers are automatically generated by ProBIND. You control how the 
NS records are generated when you describe your BIND servers.

You are now ready to populate the database. You can do this manually, 
or you can use the etc/import script to load an existing BIND configuration
with zone files into the database. 

4.1 Using the import script
===========================

You probably already have a BIND installation that you want to streamline
the management of. Otherwise you would not be looking at this program.
The good news is that there is a small PHP script included with ProBIND,
etc/import, which automates the task of converting BIND named.conf and
zone files to ProBIND database entries. 

To import your BIND configuration, copy named.conf and all of your zone 
files into a directory on your ProBIND host. 

Then execute this command:

/www/htdocs/probind/etc/import -v $PWD/named.conf | tee import.log

Note the $PWD prefix on the filename. Due to a peculiarity of PHP
as a stand-alone interpreter, it is necessary to specify the full
path to the source file.

Review the import log and the database carefully. You do not want to
update your BIND servers until your are confident that the database
accurately represents your DNS data.

If you have a lot of comments in your zone files, run import with the -a
flag too (i.e. import -av $PWD/named.conf). That way the unaltered text of 
a zone file is put into the ProBIND database as a comment text for the zone.

4.2 Update the BIND servers
===========================

When you are satisfied with the contents, click the 'Update' link to
generate the zone files and distribute them to the servers. You can
inspect the zone files generated in the tmp/master directory in the
ProBIND installation.

If you want to see what ProBIND would do to your servers, without actually
letting it touch them, specify the "nop" update script in the BIND server
descriptions. This will let ProBIND generate all the files it thinks are
needed on your BIND server, but not actually copy them. You can examine
the generated files in the tmp/master and tmp/slave directories.

NB: The "push" script included uses openssh to copy files from the ProBIND
server to the BIND servers. This assumes that Openssh trust relationships
have been set up between the ProBIND computer and the BIND servers. 

5 Troubleshooting
=================

5.1 Web server configuration
----------------------------

Your web server must have write access to $TOP/tmp in order to write
the named.conf and zone files. Either chown the tmp dir to whichever
userid web server is running under, or chmod it to mode 01777. Either
way, make sure that it is empty before running your first update!

Another way updates can fail is if the PHP interpreter is configured
for safe_mode. ProBIND relies on several external program for tasks
like generating zone files, updating BIND servers and making specialized
queries agains external name servers. And ProBIND-1.0 plain doesn't work
in safe_mode. 

5.2 Pushing updates/using SSH
-----------------------------

The sample "push" script depends on ssh to copy files from your probind
server to one or more BIND servers. This means that your web server userid 
must somehow be allowed to copy files to the name server userid on the BIND
server, without password prompts. 
An example to illustrate this: ProBIND is installed under an Apache server
running under userid nobody on host foo.example.com. BIND is running
under userid root on host bar.example.com. The problem is that a very
untrusted user (nobody@foo.example.com) needs to upload data to 
root@bar.example.com, and reload the name server. Additionally, SSH insists
on having a home directory so it can keep a database of keys in ~/.ssh.
There are several ways around this. They include: 
1a) Make apache on foo run under a more privileged user id (e.g. root), or
1b) Make $TOP/sbin/push setuid to a more privileged user id, or
1c) Give the nobody user a home directory with write access
(The least bad idea of these is probably 1a, but this depends a lot on
circumstances.)
2)  Make this more privileged trusted by root on bar. This is as easy
as appending the /root/.ssh/identity.pub file from foo to /root/.ssh/known_hosts
on bar. (or id_dsa.pub to known_hosts2).
3)  Verify that you can ssh from root@foo to root@bar without being prompted 
for a password.

5.2 Table 'SQL9a3a_0' is full
-----------------------------

Your database has run out of temporary storage for executing a large
query. This can happen in several places, but especially on the
'Tools' page. To solve this, either upgrade to Mysql 3.23, or set
the big-tables option in /etc/my.cnf:

[mysqld]
big-tables
