Internal consistency: Find CNAMES which point to non-existent RRs

Implement a tool for delegating a subdomain, including the 
necessary glue records (another section on "Add zone" ?).

Import RRs from another domain, e.g. "I want MX records here
like there is in foobar.com"

Maybe we need to be able to define multiple templates?

A tool for administrating the typesort table ?

Improve the well-formed checking for MX records domains: Either
FQDN or a dot-less domain? Or just another internal consistency check?

Support higher-order in-addr.arpa domains.

Multiple ProBIND instances in one MySQL database ?

Feedback from the BIND server log files.

A better way of communicating between ProBIND and BIND. The current
openssh scheme places an undue burden on the DNS administrator, who
has to write and/or debug a shell script that can only copy data in one
direction. Something easier, with two-way capability, is needed.

If you have a _lot_ of domains, it might be nice to have a mechanism
for grouping domains. Explicit label? Search criteria?

A read-only mode, to enable browsing by personnel unauthorized to make
changes.

Maybe it would be nice to associated ProBIND users with specific domains,
so that customers could administer their own domains without risk to 
other domains in the database.

Integration with the ISC DHCP server, so Probind can be used to track
DDNS updates.

In settings, add a template for zone entries in named.com. Add a field
to the zone description, to include in the zone entry for that zone.

Make probind compatible with PHP safe_mode.

Add a flag to the domain description that can make a domain inactive,
without actually removing it from the database. 

Improve the documentation, e.g with some MySQL howto info - not hostmaster
is a seasoned MySQL DBA.
